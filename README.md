Q1
git is an open source distributed version control system, the user in the local or server on the project source code for a variety of operations, such as versioning, collaborative development. And github is a git-based online code hosting platform, through Git for a variety of operations, with rich community and social features, is the main hosting platform for many open source projects.

Q2
Distributed version control, which allows software developers to work together on a software development project, but without having to work on the same network system. It works by making a copy of the complete code base on each developer's computer, along with a complete history of the software development project.

Q3
Git has three states: Staged, Commited, and Modified. odified means that a file has been modified, but not yet saved to the database. Staged means that the current version of a modified file has been marked so that it will be included in the next commit snapshot. Committed means that the data has been safely stored in the local database.

Q4
i) Git clone is a Git command for cloning an existing project from a remote repository. The remote repository is the origin of the clone.
ii) git status is a Git command for displays the status of the file, which corresponds to the 3 forms of git mentioned above.
iii) git fetch is a Git command for fetches the latest updates from the remote repository to the local repository, but does not merge them into the current branch.
iv) git init is a Git command for initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, turning the current directory into a Git project.
v) git log is a Git command for looks at the commit history of your Git repository. This is useful for reviewing and finding the history of your commits for things like version rollbacks and comparisons.

Q5
The .gitignore file is a configuration file designed to tell Git “which files or directories do not need to be tracked and committed to the repository”. It prevents files from being uploaded that are not relevant to the project or should not be uploaded. It basically indicates that a file, folder, etc. should be ignored. This is mainly to avoid committing unnecessary files and to make collaboration more efficient.

Q1
In order to understand the work of software testers and quality assurance analysts, the process of software conceptualization, development, and maintenance, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) describes the process, covering all phases from requirements conceptualization to post-maintenance. Typically, clients start by talking to a technology company and agreeing on an initial plan, followed by a requirements analysis and design phase to clarify details such as business rules and system architecture. After the design is completed, the team begins implementation, including writing code, setting up the environment, and developing and executing test plans by testers. During testing, defects found are reported and fixed to ensure that the system meets quality requirements before it is put into use. Finally, maintenance is equally important to ensure the continuous and stable operation of the system by monitoring the load and expanding the hardware.
Q2
SDLC is important because it clarifies goals and scope, reduces development risk, ensures software quality, improves team collaboration, and ensures sustainable maintenance.SDLC helps project teams clarify requirements and goals at the initial stage, avoiding serious subsequent deviations or rework. SDLC makes the development process easier to manage, enabling early detection of problems or risks and timely remedial measures to reduce the cost and schedule delays that may follow.SDLC enables a clear division of labor among the team, with different roles such as development, testing, and operations and maintenance performing their respective roles, avoiding confusion and duplication of effort. Duplication of labor. SDLC enables teams to maintain constant communication about changes, progress, and requirements, and ensures that maintenance and operations are maintained at a later stage. Prepare for future upgrades, expansions, and troubleshooting possibilities, making the software more scalable and easier to maintain stability and reliability after go-live.
